    "- **About**:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, to be familiar with different search methods and their time and space complexity, efficiency ,etc is the major point. Through a defined problem, 3 major search algorithms are going to be implemented: BFS, IDS(or IDDFS) and A*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Problem Modeling**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important issue in search problem is components modeling. In this problem we have a plan of city per each step. Plan consists of an ambulance, some patients, some hospitals, and some obstacles(all of them except restaurant can be 0 or more. It depends on the state.). According to time ans space issue, it is vital to model search components in the best way. The way we chose to model these, came below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **1.Initial State**:\n",
    "> It is clear that initial state is the map which is given as input. The way of saving data structure, came later.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">**2.Actions**:\n",
    ">Going uo, down, right and left are only allowed actions which we can take if possible. It means that some situations may prevent us from taking special action in special state, like walls, obstacles, etc.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">**3.Transition Model**:\n",
    ">After determining initial state and actions, we should be able to switch from one state to another by actions. So we need a transition model. In this problem, we defined a function which decides based on the current state and selected action to go to another state. It checks all conditions and apply proper changes on current state to reach next one. To explain more, consider a state in which ambulance('A'), a patient('P'), and a hospital with capacity 2 (shown with number 2) are came one after each other('A' 'P' 1). It is obvious that by taking a Right action we can transfer patient to the hospital. Defined transmition model in this situation, change location of 'A' from (i,j) to (i+1,j), remove 'P' from data structure and decrease hospital capacity to 1. As well as this, it checks all other conditions according to the comments written for each one in their functions.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">**4.Goal State**:\n",
    ">to transfer all patients to hospitals is our goal in this problem. Clearly it is the state in which there is no patients. As soon as we reach this, problem is finished.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">**5.Path Cost**:\n",
    ">In this problem switching between state does not cause cost for us, however it is better to reach goal state in minimum time and minimum number of states we should visit, and it depends on search algorithm and implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Structure**:\n",
    "\n",
    "We mentioned dictionary as used data structure used for modeling before, to talk about details It will be noticable that initial state will be read from file and stored in a dictionary. In order to save space, walls around the city and empty cells have not been saved in dictionary. It just consist of locations of obstacles, hospitals, patients, and ambulance. Locations of obstacles and patients are mapped to character '#' and 'P'. For hospitals, their locations are mapped to their capacity (type 'int'). It helps us to update state way easier when a petient has been transfered to hospital. hospital's capacity decreases by 1 and if equals to 0, hospital will be erased from dictionary. At last for ease of access, character 'A' is mapped to ambulance's location in order to find in complexity O(1)."

To explain more about data structures, it would be notable that set and dictionary data structure in Python are way faster than lists. In this case, we have to save states in frontier as FIFO, so there is no choice to use list. During each iteration, first element will removed from list and after considering all actions, will be saved in explored. Since explored variable should not be saved in special way, we can save states in a set,but dictionary data type in Python is not hashable. Because of that we save hash(frozenset(state.items()) in explored. By this way we face a significant reduction of time and space.\n",
